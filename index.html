          Q: So I have started seeing this in a lot in designer portfolios and
          resumes recently. A candidate will have a title that says “My Skills”,
          and below are bar graphs that are in percentages. What do the
          percentages mean? If you say Photoshop: 85%, does that mean you know
          85% of all there is to know about Photoshop? Is this even a good way
          to represent this? I’m afraid it makes no sense to me.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- main copy (running text) begins here -->
      <p>
        “Photoshop: 85%,” this makes 0% sense to me which is to say,
        none-at-all. And since when in the hell is Photoshop a skill?
      </p>

      <p>
        In the last 25 years, I have personally reviewed hundreds of
        applications, resumes, and portfolios. As I recall, the “percentages”
        started appearing around the time Nicolas Felton started to publish
        <a href="http://feltron.com/">annual reports</a> with visualized data on
        all facets of his life in 2004. A year or two later young persons, fresh
        out of school, started trying to make their resumes stand out by
        visualizing their data, even when it meant making things up.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are two problems with this. First, trying to communicate something
        as a percentage of 100 without any context. Second, mistaking tools with
        skills — likely to fill in for a lack of experience (that’s how it comes
        across to an employer). For the sake of discussion, let’s take on the
        first problem and try to apply a percentage of knowledge to something
        broader: walking.
      </p>

      <p>
        I don’t know exactly when I started to walk upright, but I’ll take a
        stab and say that I have 43 years of experience in walking. That’s a lot
        of time on two feet, but that doesn’t mean I know everything about
        walking. For instance, I have no experience in speed walking. Walking up
        hills is an activity I try to avoid. Growing up in Alaska, I spent a lot
        of time walking in snow, but not
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_snow"
          >all types of snow</a
        >. I’ve spent time on a treadmill, but not enough that I can coach
        someone to improve their level of competency. I could go on. So where
        does that leave me in communicating my experience in walking as a
        percentage of the total? Nowhere.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is exactly where you get when trying to enumerate the fractional
        knowledge of a skill. Even with my decades of experience, don’t take my
        word for it. As soon as I came across this question, I took this problem
        to the recruiting team at
        <a href="http://www.ibm.com/design/">IBM Design</a>. This group
        evaluates thousands of applications, resumes, and portfolios each month.
        I asked what they thought about resumes that tried to convey experience
        as percentages, and I got gnarled, annoyed, confused, faces. “I hate
        that,” said one member of the team, “because I have no idea what it
        means.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Knowing their distaste for resume visualization, I inquired what format
        they preferred, and they replied with the tried and true triad of
        “beginner, intermediate, or expert.”
      </p>

      <p>
        You may think this boring, but percentages are simply not the best way
        for anyone to report their skill level. Looking for clear guidelines, I
        headed to good ole Monster, which has processed millions of
        applications. Here are their guidelines for rating skill levels:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Beginner:</dt>
        <dd>
          A novice understanding of the skill. You have exposure to the skill
          and understand its basic concepts but lack experience.
        </dd>

        <dt>Intermediate:</dt>
        <dd>
          Between a beginner and an expert. You have experience with and can
          carry out the skill but don’t understand its advanced concepts.
        </dd>

        <dt>Expert:</dt>
        <dd>
          A highly developed skill level. You have solid experience and training
          with the skill and understand advanced concepts. You demonstrate
          proficiency and superior skill level.
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <p>
        In an era of non-stop data visualization, it’s easy for designers to get
        caught up in trying to design everything, but it only works in the
        context of what needs to be communicated and how it needs to be
        conveyed. Otherwise, you’ll end up being this guy and that’s no bueno.
      </p>

      <p>
        Let’s move on to listing Photoshop as a skill. Yucky — don’t do it.
        Stating that you are an expert in Photoshop doesn’t tell me anything
        about your skill as a designer. It only tells me that you know how the
        application works, and knowing tools does not make you a designer.
        Here’s more practical knowledge from Monster:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Job-related and transferable skills are the most desirable to list on
        your resume. For each skill, indicate your skill level and years of
        experience.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        The people who hire designers want to understand what you know how to
        do, your level of competency, and how long you’ve been doing it. How
        well can you select and set type? Can you design for email and for how
        long? What is your level of competency in editorial design? There are
        many straightforward ways to promote skill levels, and they are
        fundamentally more important than reading your knowledge of
        applications.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Warning:</strong> Trying to be clever with “design” will only
        get in the way of your objectives. Whether applying for a job or
        delivering client work, apply design only when and where it’s
        appropriate. When applying for work there are better ways to stand out
        from the pack like solid typesetting, a well-written cover letter, and
        demonstrating that you can use design when and where it’s needed.
        Remember that expressing an idea in words is a vital core design skill.
        And check your spelling and grammar, because bad writing leads to
        deleted resumes 100% of the time, every time.
